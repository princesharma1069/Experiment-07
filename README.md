# Aim: To study while loop in python.
## Theory:
Types of loops: for, while, nested.
A while loop in Python is a control flow statement that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a given condition is True.
Loop condition must eventually become False.
If the condition never becomes False, it creates an infinite loop.
digit = n%10
rev = rev*10 + digit
n //= 10 ..... This reverses a number.
To reverse an element we use: rev = st[::-1] .

## Algorithm:
1. Print numbers 1 to n:
Start
Get an integer n from the user.
Initialize: Set i to 1.
Condition: While i is less than or equal to n. Output: Print the value of i. Update: Increment i by 1.
End.

2. Factorial of a Number
Start
Input: Get an integer n from the user.
Initialize: Set fact to 1.
Condition: While n is greater than 0 .Calculate: Multiply fact by $n$ and store it in fact. Update: Decrement $n$ by 1.
Output: Print the final value of fact.
End.

3. Fibonacci Series (Up to n terms)
Start
Input: Get the number of terms $n$ from the user.
Initialize: Set a = 0, b = 1, and counter i = 1.
Condition: While i is less than or equal to $n$:
Output: Print the current value of a.
Calculate: Store the sum of a and b in c.
Shift: Update a to the value of b, and b to the value of c.
Update: Increment i by 1.
End.

4. Reverse a Number
Start
Input: Get an integer n from the user.
Initialize: Set rev to 0.
Condition: While n is greater than 0:
Extract: Get the last digit using n % 10.
Append: Update rev as (rev * 10) + digit.
Reduce: Remove the last digit from $n$ using floor division (n // 10).
Output: Print the reversed number rev.
End.

5. Check Palindrome (Number & String)
Start
Input: Get the input (number or string).
Process: Reverse the input using a loop or slicing ([::-1]).
Compare: Check if the original input is equal to the reversed version.
Output: If equal, print "palindrome"; otherwise, print "not palindrome".
End.

6. Count Digits in a Number
Start
Input: Get an integer n.
Initialize: Set count to 0.
Condition: While n is not equal to 0:
Update: Increment count by 1.
Reduce: Remove the last digit from $n$ using floor division.
Output: Print the count.
End.

7. Search Element in a List 
Start
Initialize: Define a list nums and get a key to search from the user.
Iteration: Start a loop to check each index i of the list.
Check: If the element at nums[i] matches the key:
Result: Print the index and use break to exit the loop.
Else Case: If the loop finishes without finding the key, print "number not found".
End.
## Conclusion:
Hence while loop was successfully executed in python and operations were done using it.
